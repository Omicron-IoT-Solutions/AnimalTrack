## Description

![AnimalTrack](https://github.com/Omicron-IoT-Solutions/AnimalTrack/assets/141452095/f6fa2e3a-18cb-4123-8374-c1c6113ba087)

The AnimalTrack device, designed for real-time animal tracking, is an ergonomic, versatile, resistant, and environmentally sustainable innovation, which stands out for its accuracy and capacity for prolonged use, thanks to the built-in sensors and the integration of a solar panel with energy harvester technology. The intelligent system of the solar panel represents a sustainable and efficient energy source, since it produces energy continuously, even when solar radiation is low or almost zero, and through the harvester circuit stores it for later use, achieving continuous operation without relying exclusively on conventional batteries.

In addition, the device incorporates a high-precision accelerometer that performs key functions. This detects any movement or removal of the device, which is fundamental for the security and protection of the animals under surveillance, and simultaneously, allows measuring the number of steps and their activity, which is especially useful in monitoring and data analysis applications, such as detecting strange behaviors indicative of disease or labor activity, facilitating the monitoring and management of related activities, in real time, in each application.

Furthermore, geofences can be created through software, such that when a device is detected crossing these borders, an alarm is generated on the platform and/or via external alarms. At the same time, the platform allows the visualization of the animals’ routes for up to two years, achieving greater control in real time, saving on transportation resources to search for livestock, and generating valuable data, such as the animals’ preferred pastures for feeding and resting, among others.

To this end, customers are offered an optional license for the use of a remote monitoring platform for the device, supported by the manufacturer. The use of other monitoring platforms of the user’s preference is also supported.

The combination of its features makes the device an effective tool for a wide range of applications, from logistics management to animal surveillance and protection in natural or controlled environments. Its intelligent design and its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions make it an innovative, environmentally friendly, and reliable solution for every use case.

## Features
The AnimalTrack device is designed to be easily implemented and to provide relevant data on the applications in which it is integrated. To achieve this, it has several special features, including:

General:
- Communication port, where a dual communication module with protocols for LoRaWAN™/Sigfox for the US/EU/Latam/Australia zones can be installed.
- 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery, rechargeable by high-efficiency solar panel, with energy harvester technology – No battery replacement required.
- Accelerometer to detect activity, removal and movement statistics.
- Satellite tracking (Gps/Galileo/Glonass).
- Intelligent grip pattern for better adherence to the fur.
- Counterweight for proper positioning.

Web application interface for visualization of:
- Current measurements.
- Graphic record of variables for up to 2 years.

Alarm systems:
- Geofences and alerts for inactivity or removal of the device.
- Remote visualization of alarms in WEB or mobile applications.
- External alarms sent by SMS, email, voicemail, Telegram messaging service or via webhooks, to receive notifications in the most convenient way to your application.
- In addition, through the Omicron IoT Solutions continuous improvement program, enhancements are made to both hardware and software so that your application is always at the latest state of the art, and you can get the most out of your AnimalTrack devices.
